<h2 class="h3 card-title">What is ACRE?</h2>
    <p>ACRE is the <em>Association of Community Rehabilitation Educators</em>, a national membership organization that reviews and approves competency-based training curricula. ACRE certifies our College of Employment Services (CES) courses. ACRE's mission is to advocate through education to improve the quality of employment services and employment outcomes for people with disabilities.</p>
<h2 class="h3 card-title">What is the ACRE Course?</h2>
<p>The CES ACRE Course is a self-guided training that includes 11 CES courses plus activities and field work. Learners who complete the ACRE Course training will receive a Certificate of Achievement and be listed on the ACRE Certificate Registry. </p>

<h2 class="h3 card-title">How can my staff earn an ACRE Certificate?</h2>
<div class="row ">
  <div class="col-sm-7">
    <p>Your staff must complete the 2-part ACRE Course training to earn the nationally recognized ACRE certificate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> Complete 11 CES courses. Pass the final quiz on each of the 11 courses with a score of 80% or higher.</li>
      <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> Complete the ACRE Fieldwork Course, which contains 12–15 hours of supplemental activities accessed via an online learning platform led by ICI staff. These activities include:

      <li>contributing to discussion forums</li>
      <li>analyzing and responding to realistic client scenario</li

<p>College of Employment Services (CES) courses have all the information learners need to feel confident, knowledgeable, and ready to work in employment services for people with disabilities. </p>

<h2>What is ACRE? </h2>
<p>ACRE is the <em>Association of Community Rehabilitation Educators</em>, a national membership organization that reviews and approves competency-based training curricula. ACRE certifies our College of Employment Services (CES) courses. ACRE's mission is to advocate through education to improve the quality of employment services and employment outcomes for people with disabilities.</p>

<h2>What is the ACRE Supplement?</h2>
<p>The CES ACRE Supplement is a self-guided training that includes 11 CES courses plus activities and field work. Learners who complete the ACRE Supplement training will receive a Certificate of Achievement and be listed on the ACRE Certificate Registry. </p>

<h2>How can my staff earn an ACRE Certificate?</h2>
<p>Your staff must complete the 2-part ACRE Supplement training to earn the nationally recognized ACRE certificate:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> Complete 11 CES courses. Pass the final quiz on each of the 11 courses with a score of 80% or higher.</li>
  <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> Participate in 8 hours of supplemental online learning activities, which involves fieldwork in your community (this fits in with the work your employment staff are already doing), and watch three 30-minute to 1-hour webinars supplementing their CES coursework</li>
</ul>

<p>After completing this 2-part training series (11 courses + fieldwork), learners can earn the nationally recognized ACRE Certificate. Learners' names will be added to the ACRE Certificate Registry.</p>

<h2>Can staff just do the activities and field work? </h2>
<p>No. Staff must enroll in and complete Part 1 (11 ACRE-approved courses) before enrolling in Part 2 (activities and fieldwork). Your staff must complete both Parts 1 & Part 2 to earn an ACRE Certificate. </p>

<h2>What courses are included in the ACRE Supplement bundle?</h2>
	<p>11-course bundle + Field Work: $325 + $220 for field work </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Course 1</li>
    <li>Course 2</li>
    <li>Course 3</li>
    <li>Course 4</li>
    <li>Course 5</li>
    <li>Course 6</li>
    <li>Course 7</li>
    <li>Course 8</li>
    <li>Course 9</li>
    <li>Course 10</li>
    <li>Course 11</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Can my staff take CES courses without the ACRE Supplement?</h2>
<p>Yes. You can purchase CES courses separately, in different course bundles, or in the 2-part training series with the ACRE Supplement. However:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Staff cannot take the ACRE Supplement by itself</li>
  <li>Your staff must take the ACRE Supplement to earn an ACRE Certificate</li>
</ul>

<h2>How long do my staff have to complete the ACRE Supplement?</h2>
<p>Learners have 6 months to complete the CES ACRE Supplement, which includes all courses, activities, field work, and webinars. After 6 months, the learner will no longer have access to the course materials required to earn their ACRE certificate. Your staff can complete each lesson at their own pace. </p>

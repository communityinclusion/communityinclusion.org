> “_It is important to explore the intersectionality between disability, race, age, economic context, and geographic context as we work toward a more equitable workforce landscape for youth with disabilities and for all_” — DeBrittany Mitchell, PI

ExploreVR knowledge translation specialists DeBrittany Mitchell (PI) and Julisa Cully (Co-PI) published [_Over & Under: Overcoming Systemic Barriers to Employment for Underserved Youth with Disabilities in Rural Areas_](https://rehabinkmag.com/previous-issues/rehabink-winter-21-volume-1-issue-10/over-under-overcoming-systemic-barriers-to-employment-for-underserved-youth-with-disabilities-in-rural-areas/) in the online, peer-reviewed Canadian knowledge translation journal, _Rehab Ink._

Mitchell and Cully lead [the Rural Youth Apprenticeship Development Project](https://www.explorevr.org/sites/explorevr.org/files/files/RYAD_fact%20sheet4%20(2).pdf) (RYAD), which helps VR agencies develop and advance their apprenticeship programs for youth with disabilities ages 16–24 in underserved rural communities. RYAD convened vocational rehabilitation (VR) staff from across the US to share insights about systemic barriers to apprenticeship access that disproportionately impact underserved youth in rural areas.

Mitchell and Cully also presented these key insights on a panel at the University of Toronto’s “**_Social Issues in Rehabilitation: Diversity, Care and Engagement_**” online conference.

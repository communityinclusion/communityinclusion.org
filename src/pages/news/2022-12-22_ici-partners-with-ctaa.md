The Community Transportation Association of America (CTAA) received a 1-year, $485,000 grant from the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to develop the National Transportation Accessibility Center (NTAC). The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) is a partner on this project, along with USAging and DJB Evaluation & Consulting.

The NTAC will serve as a national resource and technical assistance center that encourages transportation systems to use assistive technology and other strategies to make services, program enrollment locations, websites, and mobile apps more accessible and responsive to the needs of people with disabilities and older adults. NTAC will also focus on building accessible transportation strategies and promoting accessible transportation options for families, caregivers, and historically marginalized and underserved rural communities of disabled and older adults.

This project will build off of the success of the [Transit Planning 4 All](https://transitplanning4all.org/) project that ICI has been a partner on for the last 5 years. Program Director, David Hoff and Knowledge Translation Manager, DeBrittany Mitchell from ICI will work with NTAC project partners to promote awareness of project activities, services, and findings.

The [National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services](https://www.nasddds.org/) (NASDDDS),in collaboration with ICI, published a fourth in a series of five white papers highlighting topics influencing employment outcomes and services for individuals supported by state intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) agencies.

The [latest paper](https://www.thinkwork.org/employment-journey-focus-informed-choice) provides an in-depth analysis on the concept of informed choice. It examines how making informed choices can contribute to improved employment outcomes for people with I/DD. The paper also explores the legal and policy context for fostering informed choice for all individuals, and the impacts of systemic initiatives furthering meaningful informed choice.

Members of [Self Advocates Becoming Empowered](https://www.sabeusa.org/)and [Green Mountain Self-Advocates](http://www.gmsavt.org/)reviewed NASDDDS’s white paper on informed choice and decision-making, and [wrote this response](https://www.thinkwork.org/informed-decision-making-it-takes-more-practice).

We’re pleased to be advancing the conversation on this important topic, and to have a wide range of voices at the table to debate, discuss, and move policy and practice forward.

Congratulations to ICI’s Think College and partners for accepting a $5.9 million three-year award from the US Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education to expand their remarkable work of translating and disseminating research and best practices on inclusive post-secondary education for colleges and universities across the US.

The Think College Network’s National Technical Assistance and Dissemination Center will expand the work of the Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students with Intellectual Disability Coordinating Center to address several persistent challenges facing inclusive post-secondary education for students with intellectual disability (ID). Specifically, Think College will:

*   translate and disseminate research and best practices for improving inclusive post-secondary education for students with ID to institutes of higher education
*   help colleges and universities develop, evaluate, improve, and expand their inclusive post-secondary education programs and inclusive practices for students with ID
*   promote positive academic, social, independent living, and self-advocacy outcomes for students with ID
*   support faculty, campus service providers, and families to meet the needs of students with ID

The Think College Network will engage in targeted public awareness efforts, create research-based training, and develop a regional infrastructure offering localized, customizable technical assistance and support to inclusive post-secondary education program staff, families, students, and transition professionals.

The project will also create two collaborative workgroups on career and technical education and community employment, as well as develop five new regional alliances to sustain partnerships between institutes of higher education, businesses, local education agencies, vocational rehabilitation, state developmental disability agencies, and community-based organizations. These alliances will support improved academic, social, independent living, employment, and self-advocacy outcomes for students with ID in colleges and universities across the US.

The Professional Fellows Program on Inclusive Civic Engagement is a premier professional program funded by the US Department of State for emerging leaders in Africa to exchange and implement best practices for inclusive civic engagement.  

Approximately 19 disability rights professionals (Fellows) from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ethiopia will identify a key policy or practice issue related to disability and civic engagement in their country as the focus for their customized Fellowship at a US host site organization.

**Our Inclusive Civic Engagement Advisory Board**

In January, we invited 12 experts from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, and the US to provide guidance, advice, and input on key aspects of the program to the Fellows.  

Advisory Board members from Africa provide content expertise, serve as “cultural brokers” between their countries and the US, advise Fellows on strategies for sustaining their project action plans, and help expand the Fellow alumni network.

Advisory Board members from the US also provide content expertise, advise on US host site outreach and recruitment, review program leadership training content, and help identify professional mentors and guest speakers.

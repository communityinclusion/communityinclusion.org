With funding from the US Department of State, the Institute for Community Inclusion (CI) at UMass Boston is partnering with [Humanity & Inclusion](https://www.hi-us.org/) to announce a new professional program for the next generation of African disability leaders committed to inclusive civic engagement!

Our [Professional Fellows Program on Inclusive Civic Engagement](https://pfpinclusion.org/) will support approximately 19 disability rights professionals (Fellows) from four African countries to participate in a 5-week Fellowship Program in the US. Fellows from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ethiopia will engage in an individual Fellowship placement with a university-based research and education center for disabilities or similar host site organization in the US.

**What does the Professional Fellows Program involve?**

Each Fellow will select a key policy or practice issue related to disability and civic engagement in their home country, which will provide a focus for their individual Fellowship placement training and will inform the project they will design and implement upon returning home. The Fellowship training will also include weekly leadership seminars, mentorship, and community service.

**What is Inclusive Civic Engagement?**

In the United States, civic engagement is a core strategy used by the disability community to advance the rights of people with disabilities. This idea is enshrined in the motto of the US disability rights movement, “Nothing About Us Without Us,” which has been adopted by disability rights activists internationally. It calls for people with disabilities to be involved in decisions that impact them.

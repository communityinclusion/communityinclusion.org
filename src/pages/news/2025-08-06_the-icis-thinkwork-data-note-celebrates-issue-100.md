Projects of National Significance focus on the most pressing issues affecting people with developmental disabilities and their families across the US. The ICI’s ThinkWork _Access to Integrated Employment_ (AIE) is a Developmental Disabilities Project of National Significance. Since 1988, ThinkWork’s AIE efforts have explored the factors that contribute to employment outcomes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) at multiple levels: individual employment outcomes, employment support practices, service provider engagement, and state policy reform.

This year, ThinkWork’s AIE Data Note celebrates 20 years with its 100th issue. Data Notes highlight the research on employment and day services trends and outcomes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Data Notes typically feature employment and day services data from:

- [**ICI’s National Survey of State IDD Agency Employment & Day Services**](https://www.thinkwork.org/statedata/bluebook)
- [**US Census Bureau's American Community Survey**](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/)
- [**Rehabilitation Services Administration – 911 Database**](https://rsa.ed.gov/)
- [**Social Security Administration**](https://www.ssa.gov/)
- [**National Core Indicators Project**](http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/)

Over the years, these reports have evolved to include more detailed analyses. The first Data Note, published in 2005, was titled [**_What do Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Services Cost?_**](https://www.thinkwork.org/statedata/datanote/what-do-vocational-rehabilitation-vr-services-cost) Data Note 1 summarized the average cost of VR services and presented service cost data by disability type and VR closure.

In 2011, Data Note 34 emphasized the critical goal of integrated employment for youth with IDD. In [**_Setting Higher Employment Expectations for Youth with Intellectual Disabilities_**](https://www.thinkwork.org/statedata/datanote/setting-higher-employment-expectations-youth-intellectual-disabilities), the authors shared data on employment goals listed in youths’ transition plans. Authors were surprised to find that 10% of students with IDD had “sheltered employment” listed as a primary goal, and only 53% of students with IDD had “integrated employment” listed as a primary goal.

Data Note 58 from 2017 discussed the low level of workforce participation among people who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) by age. [**_Despite Some Gains, Social Security Administration Data Show a Low Level of Workforce Participation Among SSI Recipients_**](https://www.thinkwork.org/statedata/datanote/despite-some-gains-social-security-administration-data-show-low-level-workforce) show that younger SSI recipients (ages 18–39) made up 36% of the total SSI recipients, but their workforce participation was over three times higher compared to the 40–64 age group.

Though 2025 marks the Data Note’s 20th year, ThinkWork continues to plan for the future.  Jean Winsor, Senior Associate and Principal Investigator of AIE, shared, “We are so proud to reach the milestone of 100 Data Notes! The growth in the number of people with IDD engaged in employment in their community is something we should celebrate. State Data staff look forward to continuing our work highlighting the progress in employment services and outcomes.”

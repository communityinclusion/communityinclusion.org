The ICI has released a  [series of publications](https://covid19.communityinclusion.org/) on providing day and employment services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Topics include offering services remotely, effective use of technology, dealing with the economic impact of COVID-19, and much more. Additional publications will be added in the next few weeks.

These resources have been developed to guide professionals, individuals, and families through this challenging time. This public health crisis has created emotional turmoil and economic damage. However, it is also a chance to develop new approaches to providing day and employment services and supporting community life engagement.

The LEND Program is seeking Persons With Disabilities (PWD) with an interest in advocacy and mentorship to take part in the LEND fellowship that runs from September 2022 - May 2023.  Massachusetts residents, age 23 and older with a developmental or other disabilities are eligible to apply.

LEND stands for Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and related Disabilities. The LEND Program is a joint initiative of Boston Children's Hospital's Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI), also situated at the University of Massachusetts Boston. The program is a federally funded program that provides interdisciplinary training for a diverse group of participants from the fields of study including but not limited to social work, psychology, developmental medicine, audiology, occupational therapy, nursing, public health, genetic counseling, child development, and education.  Participants also include parents of children with disabilities, and PWD who are searching for ways to increase their knowledge and learning how to better advocate for themselves and others. 

If selected, you will be required to attend classes at Boston Children's Hospital on Fridays, 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  Our classroom is public transportation and disability accessible.  Our fellows with lived experience often bring a support person with them to the program, and we are able to provide Sign Language Interpreters if needed. You will also be expected to allocate an additional 3-4 hours a week to observe hospital clinics, visit Title V program, and do visits in the community. Some of this additional activity can be done evenings/weekends, although you will need some weekday time availability.  

## Highlights:

- Seminars on leadership, evidence-based practice, interdisciplinary collaboration, cultural awareness, public health, conflict resolution, research, policy, clinical issues, and advocacy  
- Participation in disability policy conference with training in legislative issues and a chance to attend the conference in Washington DC and participate in meetings on Capitol Hill.
- Opportunity to work with community-based organizations serving diverse populations and/or children and families with special health care needs.
- In-home visits with a family with a child with a developmental disability

[Langston University](https://www.langston.edu/), a Historically Black college/university (HBCU) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma has received a 5-year $4.6 million research grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research to reduce wealth inequity among people with disabilities whose identities intersect with those of other historically underserved populations, including Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC); LGBTQIA status; poverty status; and rural geography.

[The RRTC: Equity in the Employment Domain](https://acl.gov/grants/rehabilitation-research-and-training-centers-rrtc-equity-center-employment-domain) (LU2E RRTC) at Langston University will conduct five major studies and related activities. Multiply marginalized citizen scientists with disabilities will guide this work.

The [Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI)](https://www.communityinclusion.org/) and the Institute for New England Native American Studies are excited to continue our work with Langston University. Drs. Susan Foley and Allison Taylor from the ICI and Dr. Cedric Woods and Program Director Jamie Morrison from INENAS will expand our efforts to address wealth equity for Native American/American persons with disabilities harmed by the opioid epidemic.

The ICI will be involved in two research studies on the LU2E RRTC. The first study will develop a national data collection effort to create the _Intersectional Framework for Employment Equity among Multiply Marginalized People with Disabilities._ The second study, _Understanding Disability and Employment Needs of Native American/American Indian Tribal Communities Harmed by the Opioid Epidemic: A Collaborating for Equity and Justice Approach,_ aims to understand structural challenges and solutions to the employment and economic well-being of Native American/American Indian persons with disabilities harmed by the opioid epidemic.

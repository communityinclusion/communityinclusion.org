Community life engagement (CLE) refers to people accessing and participating in their communities outside of employment as part of a meaningful life. Explore CLE is the ICI’s new hub for activities that enhance systems and services that support community life engagement for people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD).

Through Explore CLE, we offer:

* The [**CLE Toolkit**](https://cletoolkit.communityinclusion.org/), a comprehensive collection of briefs and promising practices, an interactive [Fidelity Scale](https://cletoolkit.communityinclusion.org/fidelity-scale), and other resources for service providers who support people with IDD in the community.

* [**Explore CLE Learning**](https://cletoolkit.communityinclusion.org/resources/online-cle-training-course), self-paced, online courses that can help direct support professionals build their skills and feel more confident in their role working in the community.

* **Expert technical assistance and consultation from ICI staff.** Email us at [ExploreCLE@umb.edu](mailto:ExploreCLE@umb.edu) for more information!

Community engagement can give meaning to people’s lives. People with IDD deserve opportunities to make their own personal choices, with support if they need it, about how they want to live their lives.

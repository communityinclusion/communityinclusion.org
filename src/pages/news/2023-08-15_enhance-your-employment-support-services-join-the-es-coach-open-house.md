Are you an employment support professional or a manager of an employment program? Are you seeking effective ways to enhance your supported and customized employment services, leading to improved employment outcomes for job seekers? **Join ES-Coach!**

ES-Coach enables teams of employment support professionals to visualize their supported and customized employment practices, and leverage this information to reflect, set goals, and take action for continuous quality improvement. To learn more about it, [join the ES-Coach Open House](https://communityinclusion.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAsde2pqzgvGtMT-KggYOZI5hykC320HCoK) on August 24 at 2:00 pm ET or visit [www.es-coach.org](https://www.es-coach.org/).

Here’s what other employment support professionals have to say:

_“ES-Coach makes me think about my workday and allows me to put extra goals into perspective.”_

_“I love how simple it is!”_

ES-Coach is a project of ThinkWork, at the Institute for Community Inclusion, UMass Boston. It is available at no cost thanks to the generous support from the Kessler Foundation.

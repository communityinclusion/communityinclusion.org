### ICI Learning Game Featured at National ED Games Expo

The [7th annual ED Games Expo](https://sites.ed.gov/osers/2020/01/ed-games-expo-highlights-learning-through-accessible-gaming/), held in Washington, D.C. on January 9, featured a range of educational games and learning technologies for children with and without disabilities. One featured learning tool was [Future Quest Island-Explorations](https://thinkcollege.net/about/what-is-think-college/future-quest-island-explorations) (FQI-E), developed and run by staffers on our Education & Transition team here at the ICI.

The U.S. Department of Education funded the expo, which highlighted a range of products and presenters ranging from university staffers to venture capitalists.

Future Quest Island-Explorations (FQI-E) is underwritten by a Stepping Up to Technology grant from the [Department of Education’s Office of Special Education Programs](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html), or OSEP. FQI-E is a universally designed college and career awareness game that aligns with the evidence-based Possible Selves framework, including self-concept and social-emotional skills for students with and without disability in grades 3–5.

“Attending the expo and checking out some of the 150 learning games was a really awesome and unique experience,” said Lori Cooney, a program coordinator and universal instructional design specialist at ICI who leads creation and implementation of FQI-E.

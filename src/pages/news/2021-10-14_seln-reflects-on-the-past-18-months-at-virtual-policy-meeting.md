Last week, ICI’s State Employment Leadership Network (SELN) hosted their virtual annual policy meeting with 24 member states and the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS). Experts and advocates from the field presented plenary sessions, panel discussions, and annual reflections on the state of employment and community engagement policies that impact the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).

Some meeting topics included:

*   state systems responses to individualized requests during the COVID-19 pandemic
*   the Office of Disability Employment Policy’s (ODEP) 5-year public policy priorities
*   innovative federal partnership opportunities with federal partners in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and Administration for Community Living (ACL)
*   NCI Staff Stability Survey, which aims to improve the quality and stability of direct support professionals who assist adults with IDD
*   legislation and formal policies in various states to eliminate the use of sub-minimum wage and facility-based services
*   direct support professional credentialing and whether a distinct pipeline with competency-building would address community-based employment opportunities

The SELN is a collaborative effort between [ICI](http://www.communityinclusion.org/) and the [National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services](https://www.nasddds.org/) (NASDDDS) with 24 state IDD agency members committed to improving integrated employment outcomes for people with IDD.

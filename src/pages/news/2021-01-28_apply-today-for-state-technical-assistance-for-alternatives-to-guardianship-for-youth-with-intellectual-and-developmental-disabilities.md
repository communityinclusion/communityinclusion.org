The Center for Youth Voice/Youth Choice (CYVYC) National Resource Center at the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) announces an opportunity for states to apply to participate in a Community of Practice on Alternatives to Guardianship for Youth with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD).

This Community of Practice will foster a rich dialogue around best practices, provide a framework for sustainable change, and center the voices of youth leaders in this work.

Community of Practice member states will work in partnership with thought leaders and national experts on guardianship alternatives to create lasting systemic change.

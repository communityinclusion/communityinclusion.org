We are kicking of the month by exploring Black History in Boston. Take some time this month to learn about [The William Monroe Trotter Institute for the Study of Black Culture](https://www.umb.edu/trotter) at UMass Boston, established in 1984 to address the concerns of Black communities in Boston and Massachusetts through research, technical assistance, and public service.

Lillian Semper Ross is the founder of the UMass Boston Ross Center for Disability Services. Lillian became blind as an adolescent. She graduated from UMass Boston in the 1960s, and in 1970, wrote a grant to UMass to start the Resource and Counseling Center for Blind Students, which became the Ross Center for Disability Services we know today. Lillian Semper Ross went on to work for the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind and continued to advocate for disability rights in Boston and across the US.

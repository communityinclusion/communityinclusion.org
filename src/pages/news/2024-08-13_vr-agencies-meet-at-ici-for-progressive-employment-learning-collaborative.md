Earlier this summer, the Progressive Employment Learning Collaborative met at the ICI to discuss lessons learned about Progressive Employment’s impact on job seekers with disabilities and businesses in their communities.

The Progressive Employment Learning Collaborative includes representatives from nine vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, ICI staff, and partners at the [Disability Policy Consortium](https://www.dpcma.org/) and [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/).

The Learning Collaborative came together in a cross-state forum to solve problems, identify and apply solutions, and measure outcomes and results through research and evaluation activities. VR agency staff shared Progressive Employment implementation progress in each of their states.

Kelly Haines, PI of the Center on Scaling Up Progressive Employment project, shared her gratitude and excitement about the meeting:

“The Progressive Employment Learning Collaborative serves as a vehicle for pushing the research and implementation of the Progressive Employment model forward. We are so thankful to have had the opportunity to host all our Progressive Employment partners here in Boston this year for our 9th annual meeting.”

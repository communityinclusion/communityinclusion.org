A new  [AT Data Brief](https://catada.info/assets/files/ATAP_2020_F.pdf)  examines the usage and impact of assistive technology programs in the U.S. and its territories.

Written by ICI staffers John Shepard and Daria Domin, the brief highlights data from FY 2019 about device demonstration, loans, reuse, and other aspects of AT programs. These federally funded programs make it easier for people with disabilities to try out and acquire the technology they need to thrive at home, at school or work, and in their communities.

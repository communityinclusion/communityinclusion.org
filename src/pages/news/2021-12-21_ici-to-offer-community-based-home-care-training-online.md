The Institute for Community Inclusion has been working with the Executive Office of Elder Affairs to expand the workforce of community-based home care workers in Massachusetts. This year, we launched the online [Personal and Home Care Aide State Training (PHCAST)](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/take-the-first-step-to-prepare-for-a-career-in-the-health-care-industry), a free, virtual, self-paced training for anyone interested in becoming a community-based home care worker in Massachusetts. Over one thousand individuals have registered for the course since February 2021.

Home care aides are an integral part of the in-home care team. They provide services that support older adults and persons with disabilities to live and thrive in their homes and communities. Home care aides promote self-determination and support older adults and persons with disabilities to make decisions about their care and lifestyle.

PHCAST is a self-paced, video-based, 11-module online training adapted from Commonwealth Medicineâ€™s in-person training. Learners can complete each module from their home computer or smartphone. The modules cover the roles and responsibilities of a home care aide, including skills like active listening, nutrition planning, housekeeping, working with consumers, and more.

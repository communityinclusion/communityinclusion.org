The Institute for Community Inclusion was recently awarded the  _Program on Innovative Rehabilitation Training on Employer Engagement Innovative Rehabilitation Training Program_  (PIRTEE), a Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) grant. The PIRTEE program focuses on creating and providing training related to employer engagement. The goal is to integrate research and emerging evidence into training for the VR system, rehabilitation professionals, and para-professionals, and to infuse that same information into academic programs on rehabilitation counseling.

Led by co-principal investigators Julisa Cully and Cecilia Gandolfo, the PIRTEE program will build upon the  [toolkits](https://www.explorevr.org/toolkits)  created through the RSA-funded Job-Driven VR Technical Assistance Center by creating four curricula for online and in-person training.

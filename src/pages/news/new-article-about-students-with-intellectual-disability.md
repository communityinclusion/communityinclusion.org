[Debra Hart](https://thinkcollege.net/authors/hart), principal investigator for the Institute for Community Inclusion’s [Think College](http://www.thinkcollege.net/) project, co-wrote an article for _Diverse Issues in Higher Education_ titled “[Left Out? Can the Completion Movement Reach Students with Intellectual Disabilities](https://diverseeducation.com/article/165667/).”

The article examines how the [new data](https://nscresearchcenter.org/signaturereport16/) finding that nearly 42% of college students failed to earn degrees within six years and the efforts to close that gap have impacted students with intellectual disability. Around 6.5 million Americans have an intellectual disability, however in the past decade and a half students with intellectual disabilities are attending college at the lowest rate of students from any disability category.

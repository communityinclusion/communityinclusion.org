“Dr. Helm has been an excellent teacher for his trainees of varied disciplines. He imbued them with compassion, ability to learn from one another, and to work together. He is a truly interdisciplinary person, who has the talent to teach others how to be members of a team, not limited by the boundaries of one’s own discipline…He is also a warm person and great friend, caring for his patients and students and a model for them.”

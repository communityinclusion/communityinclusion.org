Your students are learning and growing in an ever-changing world. Join the Institute for Community Inclusion’s (ICI) research program for elementary school teachers to help your students develop career awareness, self-concept, and social-emotional competencies.

**What is Future Quest Island Explorations?**  
Think College at the ICI University of Massachusetts Boston and our partner [FableVision](https://www.fablevisionstudios.com/) created [Future Quest Island-Explorations](http://www.fqie.org/) using the evidence-based Possible Selves Framework. The Possible Selves curriculum helps students in elementary school discover who they are as a person, friend, learner, and worker by setting goals and identifying their hopes, dreams, and preferences.

Together, we have built a universally designed, accessible, standards-based curriculum with interactive game play to introduce your students to fun careers in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM).

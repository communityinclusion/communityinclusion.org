Does your organization provide day services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities? We need your help testing our new **Guidepost Fidelity Scale (GFS)**!

Our aim with the GFS is to help service providers better understand how their day services and supports align with the Four Guideposts for Community Life Engagement (CLE).


![Community Life Engagement Guideposts: 1. Individualize supports for each person 2. Promote community membership and contribution 3. Use human and social capital to decrease dependance on paid supports. 4. Ensure that supports are outcome-oriented and regularly monitored.](../../images/CLE_guideposts-sq.png)


##How can you help?

* Identify 5 or more of your staff who are familiar with your day services
* Those 5 staff will complete the online GFS, which should take about a half-hour per staff member to complete

##Why should you participate?

* Testing this scale in the real world is an essential step to making it useful for service providers
* Your staff will gain early access to ICIâ€™s CLE Online Modules for Direct Support Professionals

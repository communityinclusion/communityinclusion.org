**What is #IPSEDay2022?**

Inclusive Postsecondary Education Day, or #IPSEDay2022, is a day to raise awareness and spread the word about inclusive postsecondary education (IPSE) options for students with intellectual disabilities.

There are about 5,300 colleges & universities in the US and just over 300 have options for students with intellectual disabilities.

There are more options now than ever before, but we have a lot more work to do. There are still so many people — students, parents, teachers, college staff — who just don’t know that college is an option for students with intellectual disabilities. Let’s change that!

This year on IPSE Day, we invite students, families, friends, educators, allies, and supporters to share why **_you_** think IPSE is important.

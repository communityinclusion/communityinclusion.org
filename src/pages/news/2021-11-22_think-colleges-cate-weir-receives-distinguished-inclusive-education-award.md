Congratulations to Think College program director, Cate Weir! Cate has received the George Jesien National Leadership Award, which honors dedicated individuals “who reflect significant work either at the federal level or across state lines, in terms of advocacy, assistance, and/or research on inclusive higher education.” The George Jesien National Leadership Award is named for Dr. George Jesien, a national leader in the disabilities field.

Cate accepted her award at the 2021 virtual [State of the Art Conference on Inclusive Postsecondary Education and Individuals with Intellectual Disability](https://www.sotaconference.com/), themed Inclusive Higher Education: Disability, Equity, and Social Justice.

Cate shared her passion for inclusive higher education and gratitude for her community in her acceptance remarks:

“I have the best job in the world. I’m able to have a little part of affecting change by working alongside the best and most committed educators, the most tenacious parents, and the most trailblazing students. I’m continually awed by your commitment to the ideals of inclusion and diversity, equity, and social justice, as well as your generosity, collegiality, and creativity, and most importantly, your refusal to take ‘no’ as an answer. To be even a small part of making these changes to higher education is a privilege. Knowing how skilled and dedicated that you are in this movement…I look forward to continuing to work to lead when required, but mostly, to support and encourage and lift up as we do the hard work of making the world a more equitable place.”

Cate has dedicated over twenty years working to ensure that students with intellectual disability can attend college. She has served as the project coordinator for the Think College National Coordinating Center since its inception in 2010, where she coordinates all project activities, including technical assistance, training, dissemination, and data collection.

Please join us in congratulating Cate for this outstanding achievement!

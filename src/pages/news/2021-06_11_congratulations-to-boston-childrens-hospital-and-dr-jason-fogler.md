Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) Director, David Helm, PhD, is proud to announce the LEND program at the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at Boston Children’s Hospital has just received a new 5-year award to continue to offer expert interdisciplinary training about developmental disabilities to health and counseling professionals, families, and self-advocates.

The LEND program focuses on public policy, advocacy, diversity, stigma, human rights, and new designs in the developmental disabilities field. LEND fellows work to improve health care delivery systems for children with developmental disabilities and promote innovative practice models that enhance cultural competency, interdisciplinary work, and family-centered approaches to health care.

Under this new award, Dr. Jason Fogler has been promoted to LEND Training Director. Dr. Fogler has extensive experience in administering, teaching, and researching innovative therapies for patient populations and psychosocial contexts, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), complex trauma, and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. He has authored over 50 publications and contributed to two books about trauma and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Five Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) staff have published articles in the latest [*Impact, Feature Issue on Employment and IDD*](https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/37-2/cover?j=12998415&sfmc_sub=669881332&l=79433_HTML&u=267485501&mid=6379454&jb=1) by the Institute on Community Integration at the University of Minnesota.

The Institute on Community Integration publishes [*Impact*](https://ici.umn.edu/series/14) three times a year. This free newsletter publication features research, strategies, and success stories for and by people with disabilities, their families, educators, community service providers, policymakers, and advocates.

ICI’s Senior Technical Assistance and Policy Associate Staci Jones wrote “[Building Momentum: Innovation in Competitive Integrated Employment](https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/37-2/innovation-in-competitive-integrated-employment)” with co-author Danielle Mahoehney from the Institute on Community Integration. The authors emphasize the need for systems change to increase access to community-based jobs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). They share promising practices to help address this need.

Jones also wrote “[Evolving Day Services: Bridging Community Life and Employment for People with Disabilities](https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/37-2/evolving-day-services-bridging-community-life-and-employment-for-people-with-disabilities?j=12998415&sfmc_sub=669881332&l=79433_HTML&u=267485574&mid=6379454&jb=1)” about the national shift from facility-based day habilitation services to integrated, community-focused day programs for people with IDD. She reviews various US policies that have encouraged this evolution.

ICI Program Director David Hoff authored “[Emerging and Ongoing Policy Efforts in Community Employment](https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/37-2/emerging-and-ongoing-policy-efforts-in-community-employment).” Hoff shares examples of state and federal policies that have helped prioritize community-based employment for people with IDD. He highlights the trends and the continued efforts by states to eliminate sheltered workshops and subminimum wage employment.

ICI Training Associates Gail Godwin and Bryn Peterson co-authored “[Perfect Pair: Employment Services in Self-Directed Settings](https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/37-2/perfect-pair-employment-services-in-self-directed-settings),” in which they discuss the flexibility, customizability, and benefits of self-directed support services for people with IDD.

Alberto Migliore, ICI Research Associate, wrote “[ES-Coach: Supporting Employment Consultants in the Workflow](https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/37-2/es-coach-supporting-employment-consultants-in-the-workflow)” with co-author Sherry Healey from the Institute on Community Integration. Migliore and Healey highlight how ES-Coach uses data to enhance employment consultants’ goal setting, action planning, and workflow learning, ultimately increasing their confidence, value, and growth while improving job seekers’ employment outcomes

Dr. Heike Boeltzig-Brown from ICI has partnered with Humanity & Inclusion to introduce a new professional fellowship program for African disability leaders committed to inclusive civic engagement, the Professional Fellows Program on Inclusive Civic Engagement.

Funded by the US Department of State, the program will support 19 disability rights professionals from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ethiopia to participate in a 5-week Fellowship. Fellows will complete an individual Fellowship placement with a university-based research and education center for disabilities or similar host site organization in the US.

Fellows will select a key policy or practice issue related to disability and civic engagement in their home countries, which will provide a focus for their individual Fellowship placement training and will inform the project they design and implement upon returning home. The Fellowship training will also include weekly leadership seminars, mentorship, and community service.

Heike shared, “We’re honored and excited to implement this new fellowship program in partnership with Humanity & Inclusion to provide opportunities for a new generation of African disability leaders committed to inclusive civic engagement.”

ICI joins the Department of Labor (DOL) in celebrating the 8th Annual National Apprenticeship Week. DOL describes this week as “an opportunity to highlight how Registered Apprenticeship, a proven and industry-driven training model, provides a critical talent pipeline that can help to address some of our nation’s pressing workforce challenges such as rebuilding our country’s infrastructure, addressing critical supply chain demands, supporting a clean energy workforce, modernizing our cybersecurity response, and responding to care economy issues.”

### **The Rural Youth Apprenticeship Development Project**

The Rural Youth Apprenticeship Development Project (RYAD) supports the development and advancement of vocational rehabilitation (VR) apprenticeship programs for youth with disabilities in underserved rural communities. By building the capacity of state VR agencies to create apprenticeship programs in collaboration with local businesses and workforce system partners, the RYAD Project aims to:

- increase access to youth apprenticeship programs in rural areas where there are higher rates of people with disabilities who face lower rates of employment, and

- improve employment outcomes for youth with disabilities in rural communities.

### **Massachusetts State Apprenticeship Expansion, Equity, and Innovation Project**

The Massachusetts State Apprenticeship Expansion, Equity, and Innovation Project goals are to:

- increase apprenticeship diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts

- develop partnerships with new industries and non-traditional occupations

- align Registered Apprenticeships with other work-based learning opportunities within state education and workforce systems

The Massachusetts Division of Apprenticeship Standards (DAS) is the lead on this project. ICI is a subcontractor to DAS on this effort, focusing on facilitating the successful placement of individuals with disabilities to Registered Apprenticeships in Massachusetts.

### Registered Apprenticeship Technical Assistance Center of Excellence: Diversity and Inclusion

The Registered Apprenticeship Technical Assistance Center of Excellence: Diversity and Inclusion focuses on expanding opportunities in Registered Apprenticeships for individuals involved in the corrections system, people of color, people in rural communities, people with disabilities, women, and youth. The Center shares best practices for recruiting and retaining individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in Registered Apprenticeships.

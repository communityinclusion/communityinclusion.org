Our Barbara Wilensky Gopen Memorial Fellowship and Allen C. Crocker Family Fellowship are part-time fellowship programs. Fellows work independently for up to 20 hours per week on projects of their choice and attend trainings and events to learn about disability advocacy, services, and policy. 

Both fellowships begin in July 2024 and end in June 2025. Fellows can work remotely, but they must be Massachusetts residents.  

The **Barbara Wilensky Gopen Memorial Fellowship** is for Massachusetts residents with developmental disabilities. [Read more information about the Gopen Fellowship and learn how to apply!](/about/fellowships/gopen/)

The **Allen C. Crocker Family Fellowship** is for Massachusetts residents who are family members of people with developmental disabilities. [Read more information about the Crocker Fellowship and learn how to apply!](/about/fellowships/crocker)

**The deadline to apply for both Fellowships is April 12, 2024 5:00pm**. Please share widely with your networks!

Gopen and Crocker Fellowships are sponsored by Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Network partners: The Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass Boston, Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Council, E.K. Shriver Center at UMass Chan Medical School, and the Disability Law Center.

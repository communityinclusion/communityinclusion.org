This June, we celebrate disabled LGBTQ+ advocates!

## History & Now

Disability is often erased from historical accounts when we learn of activists who fought for collective struggles. Today, people with disabilities are more likely to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender than people without disabilities. [Learn about Disability Justice and the unique strengths of those advocating at the intersection of disability and LGBTQ+ identity](https://www.communityinclusion.org/news/2022-06-21_happy-lgbtq-pride-month/)!

## Youth Leaders

Young people with disabilities are leaders in the LGBTQ+ community. Advocates for Youth celebrates queer youth with [_Queer & Now_](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/celebrate-queer-youth-this-pride-month-with-queer-now-your-guide-to-pride) stories.

## Celebrate Locally

Boston’s LGBTQ+ Pride parade and festival is back this year! Boston Pride for the People will relaunch the event on June 10, 2023 for the first time in person since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The festival will take place on Boston Common and City Hall Plaza. Event organizers plan to include sober areas, quiet spaces, and other proactive accommodations for people with disabilities and older members of the LGBTQ+ community.

[Boston Pride For The People](https://www.bostonprideforthepeople.org/) is a volunteer-led organization that formed in 2019 to reimagine a more inclusive Boston Pride. Boston Pride For The People celebrate “_the rich diversity, culture, and intersectionality of the LGBTQ+ community_.” Read more about Boston Pride For The People and [their mission to empower, celebrate, commemorate, and educate](https://www.bostonprideforthepeople.org/about) about disrupting and dismantling systems that harm LGBTQ+ people who are marginalized.

## Post-COVID Pride?

As some people move on from the COVID-19 pandemic, many queer people with disabilities are still living with the effects of long COVID and concerns about contracting the virus.

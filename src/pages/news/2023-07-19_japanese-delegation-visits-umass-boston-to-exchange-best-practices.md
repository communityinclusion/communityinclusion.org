In May, ICI’s Dr. Heike Boeltzig-Brown, Senior Manager of International Partnerships, hosted a delegation from Japan at UMass Boston. The 4-person delegation represented Gifu University, Ritsumeikan University, and the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Some of these delegates had previously participated in the Leadership Institute on College Students with Disabilities in Higher Education in Japan, an ICI project funded by the Nippon Foundation, that trained Japanese university disability and career professionals in supporting students with disabilities to obtain employment after graduation. Dr. Boeltzig-Brown led the project.

During their visit, the delegation met with Hannah Kaplan Huynh, Assistant Director of the Ross Center for Disability Services, and her colleagues. They exchanged best practices in supporting students with disabilities and coordinating with health and counseling services. The Japanese delegates presented on the state of disability, health, and counseling services for Japanese college students with disabilities. Huynh expressed interest in continuing collaboration with the Japanese delegation through the ICI.

In addition to meeting with the Disability Services team, the Japanese delegates also had the opportunity to consult with staff from Health Services and the Counseling Center. Center Director Dr. Kimberly Santora and Staff Psychologist Zeljka Mileusnic met with the delegation to discuss approaches and services their departments provided to students before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The delegates were able to tour the facilities, gaining further insights into UMass Boston’s student support systems.

Overall, the visit gave the Japanese delegation an opportunity to learn from UMass Boston’s experiences and expertise in supporting students with disabilities and coordinating with health and counseling services. We look forward to continuing our partnership and opportunities for shared learning about disability with the Japanese delegation.

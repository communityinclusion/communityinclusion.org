The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston is proud to announce that [Think College](https://thinkcollege.net/about/what-is-think-college) will continue to lead as the long-standing National Coordinating Center (NCC) for the Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities (TPSID). Think College was awarded a 5-year $10 million grant from the US Department of Education for the NCC.

Think College has proudly served as the NCC since the TPSID initiative began in 2010. This continuation award will allow Think College and the ICI to support and advance higher education opportunities for students with intellectual disability through ongoing program development, evaluation, and continuous improvement.

Students with intellectual disability belong on college campuses. Over 300 US colleges and universities offer programs for students with intellectual disability, including [UMass Boston’s Inclusive Education Initiative](https://thinkcollege.net/programs/umass-boston-inclusive-education-initiative). With Think College’s support, the UMass Boston Inclusive Education Initiative provides higher education and campus engagement opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities and autism. UMass Boston’s program works with local school districts and state disability agencies to help students improve their academic, social, and career outcomes by sharing the same experiences as their college peers.

The Think College NCC partners on this important initiative with the [Association of Higher Education and Disability](https://www.ahead.org/home) (AHEAD), [Inclusive Postsecondary Education (IPSE) Association](https://ipseassociation.org/), [Taishoff Center for Inclusive Higher Education at Syracuse University](https://taishoffcenter.syr.edu/), [Warner School of Education Center for Disability and Education at University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/warner/cde/), and the [Inclusive Higher Education Accreditation Council](https://www.iheacouncil.org/home) (IHEAC). Together, they will work to build and enhance high-quality, sustainable college options for students with intellectual disability in Massachusetts and all across the US.

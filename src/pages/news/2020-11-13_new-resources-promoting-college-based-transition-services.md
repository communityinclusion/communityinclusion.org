In collaboration with MAICEI partners, as well as some out-of-state special education administrators doing similar work, Maria Paiewonsky and Ty Hanson have worked to create three new briefs, [three new student snapshots](https://thinkcollege.net/resource/college-based-transition-services-cbts/maicei-student-snapshots), and a [new student profile](https://thinkcollege.net/sites/default/files/files/resources/TCT_SP6_Brendon_College_Experience.pdf). These publications have been developed to promote college-based transition services.

The briefs are each on topics related to college-based transition services: [Transition Leadership: Special Education Administrators Support College-Based Transition Services](https://thinkcollege.net/sites/default/files/files/resources/IB_46_Transition_Leadership_SpEd_Administrators.pdf), [Building an Inclusive Postsecondary Model of Services](https://thinkcollege.net/sites/default/files/files/resources/IB_47_Building_Inclusive_Postsecondary_Model_Services.pdf), and [Supporting Student Storytelling as a Form of Advocacy for Inclusive Postsecondary Education](https://thinkcollege.net/sites/default/files/files/resources/IB_48_Supporting_Student_Storytelling.pdf).

All of these publications can be found in the Think College Resource Library and on our [Innovation Exchange page](https://thinkcollege.net/resources/innovation-exchange/dual-enrollment) on college-based transition services.

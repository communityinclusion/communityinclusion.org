Researchers from Think College and the University of South Carolina recently [published an article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2024.2311361) in the academic journal *Disability & Society* that used a participatory research method called photovoice to analyze how U.S. college students with intellectual disabilities understand self-determination.

According to the article by Think College Technical Assistance Coordinator Chelsea VanHorn Stinnett and colleagues at the University of South Carolina, the voices of people marginalized by society, such as young adults with disabilities, are often left out of research related to their lives. To address this issue, it’s important for researchers to use participatory research methods such as photovoice, a partnership where participants take photos of specific parts of their lives and then explain them to researchers.

The goal of the research, conducted by Stinnett and her South Carolina colleagues within an inclusive postsecondary education program on a U.S. college campus, was to better understand participants’ conceptualization of self-determination in their everyday lives.

Initial assignments for participants included taking photos of things they enjoy as college students and places where they feel safe, comfortable, and included. Later, participants were asked to take photos of ways in which they’ve felt challenged in being included on campus and representing ways in which they’ve had to self-advocate.

“Often young adults marginalized by society due to their disability are not afforded the same opportunities and responsibilities related to adult roles, community living, ongoing education, and employment as adults without disabilities,” according to the researchers. “The photos taken and shared through this project turned this idea on its head and showed these students accessing opportunities to live and be on campus in ways taken-for-granted by non-disabled people.”

A goal of the research, and photovoice in general, was also to inform and educate local stakeholders about participant experiences. To accomplish this, researchers hosted an exhibition of participants’ photos, which gave participants a platform to share experiences and knowledge as members of a marginalized group on campus.

The exhibition included two large-format photos from each participant, with their descriptions printed alongside the photos. The descriptions were also audio recorded to make the exhibit as accessible as possible and include actual participant voices.

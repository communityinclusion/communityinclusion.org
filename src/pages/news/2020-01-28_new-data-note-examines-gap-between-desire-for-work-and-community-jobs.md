[A new Data Note](https://www.statedata.info/sites/statedata.info/files/files/DN_64_F.pdf) looks at  the discrepancy between how many people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) want jobs, versus how many are working  in their communities. The Data Note was written  by the ICI’s [Dr. John Butterworth](https://works.bepress.com/john-butterworth/) and [Dorothy Hiersteiner](https://www.hsri.org/leadership/dorothy-hiersteiner) of the Human Services Research Institute. It uses data from the [National  Core Indicators](https://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/).

According to the Data Note, “…of the 80% [of  people with IDD] who did not have a paid community job, almost one half  (48%) indicated they would like one. Only 40% of people who stated they  would like a paid community job had this goal  documented in their Individualized Service Plan.”

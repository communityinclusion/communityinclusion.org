Disability pride month is a celebration of disability identity, history, resilience, and joy. Boston held the first Disability Pride Day and parade in 1990, following the legislation of the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://adata.org/factsheet/ADA-overview).

## Learn about disability justice this month

The [Disability Justice Collective](https://www.littleglobe.org/portfolio/disability-justice-collective/), a group of queer, disabled, women of color, initially envisioned and conceived the [Disability Justice Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_justice) in 2005 in the San Francisco Bay area. [Patty Berne](https://www.sinsinvalid.org/staff), [Mia Mingus](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/about-2/), and [Stacey Park Milbern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Milbern) were the original founders, later joined by Leroy Moore, Eli Clare, and Sebastian Margaret.

Mia Mingus, writer and disability justice organizer, defines disability justice as “_a multi-issue political understanding of disability and ableism, moving away from a rights-based equality model and beyond just access, to a framework that centers justice and wholeness for all disabled people and communities_.”

Later, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha wrote [Disability Justice: An Audit Tool](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ed94da22956b942e1d51e12/t/6232af2503a09a54615b8d48/1647488823793/DJ+Audit+Tool.pdf), envisioned with Stacey Park Milbern. This audit tool includes six practice sections including:

1.  what disability justice is
2.  how to integrate disability justice into organizing
3.  examining the disability histories in our organizations and communities
4.  discussion questions using [Sins Invalid’s 10 Principles of Disability Justice](https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/10-principles-of-disability-justice)
5.  accessibility tools designed by people with disabilities
6.  stories about disability justice organizing

Leah defined the Disability Justice Movement as _“a way of envisioning the ways people can organize around and think about disability that centers the lives and leadership of disabled Black, Indigenous and people of color and/or queer, trans, Two Spirit and gender nonconforming people.”_

The ICI’s **_Pathways Project for Caregivers of Children with Down Syndrome_** is recruiting parents and caregivers of children with Down syndrome between the ages of 10–14 to participate in an interactive Facebook group with other caregivers.

Caregivers who participate in the study can:

* Learn new information each week from Charting the LifeCourse
* Engage in online discussions with other parents and caregivers of children with Down syndrome
* Access resources and support about creating a positive vision for their children’s futures

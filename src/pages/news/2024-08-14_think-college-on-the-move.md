Several Think College team members travelled to Baltimore, MD for three events in mid-July. First, they hosted the annual TPSID Project Director Meeting, which kicked off with a [beautiful tribute video to Debra Hart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mplxiLE-WMk) compiled by Chelsea Stinnett.

The NCC Accreditation Workgroup also met in Baltimore for their annual in-person meeting and Think College staff wrapped up the busy week with an exhibit and presentation at the AHEAD (Association on Higher Education and Disability) conference.

The following week, Cate, Rebecca, Susanna, and Olivia headed to Phoenix, Arizona to participate in the National Down Syndrome Congress’ (NDSC) annual convention where they exhibited. They also hosted the sixth annual NDSC College Fair, always a fun and energizing event. Ruby’s Rainbow was in attendance and presented scholarships to college students with Down syndrome.

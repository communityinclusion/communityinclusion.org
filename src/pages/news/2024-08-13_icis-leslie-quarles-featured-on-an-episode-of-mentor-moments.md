This spring, the Institute for Community Inclusion’s (ICI) Leslie Quarles from the Missouri Employment First team was featured on an episode of the Mentor Moments podcast, [*Take a Deeper Dive into Employment First and Initiatives Supporting its Success*](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mentor-moments/id1590063983?i=1000657051053).

*Mentor Moments* interviews counselors and mentors who share unique personal and professional experiences from their fields. Leslie shared about her journey as a rehabilitation counselor, program surveyor, board member, and training associate and the importance of partnerships in each of her roles.

“Providers can look at another provider as a competitor or they can look at it as ‘we have a shared mission’. So, I think it’s really important for us to all collaborate.”

UMass Boston Transition Leadership Program Alumna

**What first attracted you to the Transition Leadership Program and to UMass Boston?**

The courses are thorough and directly applicable to my job as a for my job as a school adjustment counselor and hopeful future Transition Specialist.

**What were some of the most important lessons from the courses?**

The areas for school-based improvement, especially the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education needs assessment from the Transition Topics course, really helped inform my practicum work. The Person-Centered Planning course gave me a lot of useful tools to help my work with individuals with intensive disabilities. All of the courses emphasized the importance of developing and maintaining an interagency team.

**Why did you choose this program over other similar programs?**

I’d heard about — and was blown away by — the quality of the mentor component. My mentor still keeps in touch with mentees from years ago, and I plan to be one of them. Without my asking, my mentor connected with me other innovators in the field.

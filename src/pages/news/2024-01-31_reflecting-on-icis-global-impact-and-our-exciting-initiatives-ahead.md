As we welcome 2024 and embark on expanding ICI’s international work, we would like to take a moment to reflect on and celebrate the significant impact our staff have made on improving the lives of individuals with disabilities globally throughout 2023. This blog highlights not only past achievements but also provides a glimpse into exciting new initiatives and partnerships in 2024.

## Reflections from 2023

With funding support from the US Embassy Tokyo, the Women Leading Together: Solidarity in Storytelling Story Jam engaged 10 women from Japan and the United States in a 9-week program to explore experiences of marginalization and built community through digital storytelling. The program featured renown North American and Japanese experts in women’s rights, diversity and intersectionality, and LGBTQ+ activism as guest speakers. Story Jam culminated in the screening of participants’ 4-minute advocacy story videos at the final event on April 20 (US) / April 21 (Japan), 2023, with opening remarks by Grace Choi, Public Diplomacy Officer of the US Embassy Tokyo.

ICI staffers had two articles published in a recent edition of _Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities_. This volume focused on employment for transition-age youth with IDD.

[_“It’s Not Just About a Paycheck”: Perspectives on Employment Preparation of Students With Intellectual Disability in Federally Funded Higher Education Programs_](https://thinkcollege.net/resource/employment-supports/%E2%80%98%E2%80%98it%E2%80%99s-not-just-about-a-paycheck%E2%80%99%E2%80%99-perspectives-on-employment) examined how students with intellectual disability (ID) receive career development and employment supports and services from Transition and Postsecondary Education Programs for Students With Intellectual Disability (TPSID) model demonstration programs in the United States.

[_Engaging Families in Employment: Individuals and Families’ Retrospective Transition Experiences With Employment Services_](https://meridian.allenpress.com/idd/article-abstract/58/4/314/441696/Engaging-Families-in-Employment-Individuals-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext) uses data from the National Core Indicators Project to determine that in 2015–2016, only 19% of working-age adults supported by state IDD agencies worked in one of the three forms of integrated employment — group-supported, individual-supported, or competitive (individualized and without supports). It also examines how individual employment supports have not been implemented with fidelity to a consistent model or set of expectations, and participation in nonwork services has grown rapidly.

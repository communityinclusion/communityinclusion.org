ICI staff member Kelly Haines and Nebraska Vocational Rehabilitation’s Janet Drudik presented at the [Vocational Evaluation and Career Assessment Professionals Association 2019 National Issues Forum](https://vecap.org/), held in Richmond, VA. Kelly and Janet’s session, Progressive Employment — Assessment Practices for Upskilling/Backfilling Individuals Within Career Pathways, provided an overview of the progressive employment (PE) model as a strategy for conducting vocational evaluation and assessment in a work-based setting.

The PE model can meet the needs of both job seekers and businesses as a dual-customer strategy. “Nebraska’s application of PE as a tool for vocational evaluation and career assessment is a new angle for us to explore” said Haines.

Nebraska VR has also experienced success using the PE model as part of their [Career Pathways for Individuals with Disabilities model demonstration grant](http://www.vr.nebraska.gov/pathways/), which focuses on career advancement for workers with disabilities in high-growth/high-demand industries.

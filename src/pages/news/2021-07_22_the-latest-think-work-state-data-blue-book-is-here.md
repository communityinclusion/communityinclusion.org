What does the data say about employment and economic self-sufficiency for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in your state?

Since 1988, the ICI has collected data from state intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) agencies, the vocational rehabilitation (VR) system, the Social Security Administration, US Census, the Department of Labor, and other entities to describe trends in day and employment services for individuals with IDD.

Employment outcomes for people with disabilities have improved with the national focus on competitive, integrated employment. Yet, there are still remarkable employment disparities between people with IDD and people with other disabilities. In 2018, less than 1 in 5 working-age adults supported by IDD agencies had paid jobs in the community.

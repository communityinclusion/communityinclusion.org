The ICI is pleased to offer the U.S. — Japan Business Leadership Institute on Youth Disability Employment Webinar Series! The first webinar, _How Do We Access Employment? Japanese and American College Students and Young Professionals with Disabilities Share Barriers and Break-Throughs_, will be on February 18th from 7–8:30pm ET.

Panelists will discuss the types of barriers that they have faced as college students or professionals with disabilities and share how their experiences have shaped their lives and those of other individuals in their communities. Panelists will also share their thoughts about why such barriers exist (history of barriers) and illustrate how they overcame them (ways to move forward). The goal of this panel is to demonstrate that the problematic aspects of disability employment cannot be fixed by adjusting hiring procedure alone. To enable youth with disabilities to pursue employment, we must resolve barriers in adjacent social spheres (i.e. In education and built environment).

The webinars are free and open to public. [Registration is required](https://communityinclusion.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_nrOJsIsfSF-9yexfXYKZdg).

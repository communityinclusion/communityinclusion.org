**PRESS RELEASE**

For immediate release: February 15, 2024

* * *

BOSTON, MA – The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Boston, in collaboration with [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/) and the [Disability Policy Consortium](https://www.dpcma.org/), has been awarded a $4.5 million grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research to build the evidence base for the [Progressive Employment model](https://www.explorevr.org/progressive-employment) through its new ExploreVR Center on Scaling Up Progressive Employment.

Progressive employment is a flexible and creative employment approach that uses work-based learning strategies to meet the needs of businesses and job seekers with barriers to employment, with the goal of improving competitive integrated employment outcomes for people with disabilities.

The ExploreVR Center on Scaling Up Progressive Employment aims to increase awareness and build capacity for Progressive Employment model implementation in new areas through research, knowledge translation, training, technical assistance, and dissemination. The Center will build on more than 10 years of research and development work with public employment agencies across nine states.

In addition to Mathematica and the Disability Policy Consortium, the ICI will partner with these public employment agencies that have played crucial roles in helping build the evidence base for Progressive Employment. These agencies include the Kentucky Office of Vocational Rehabilitation Blind Services Division, Maine Bureau of Employment Services, Maine Bureau of Rehabilitation Services, Minnesota Vocational Rehabilitation Services, Missouri Vocational Rehabilitation, Nebraska Vocational Rehabilitation, New Hampshire Vocational Rehabilitation, New Jersey Commission for the Blind & Visually Impaired, Oregon Commission for the Blind, and Vermont Division of Vocational Rehabilitation.   

Kelly Haines, the Center’s Director shared, "We are so excited for this opportunity to build upon the past decade of research and development work as we look to both scale up and scale out the Progressive Employment model to new systems and communities."

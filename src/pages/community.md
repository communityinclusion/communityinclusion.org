<p>All people should have the opportunity to be fully included in their communities. Community inclusion is about participating in one’s community through leadership development, personal and professional capacity- building, and self-advocacy. We engage people with lived experience in our work to create more welcoming and accessible communities around the world for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Our community work covers a range of topical areas and complements ICI’s ongoing work on employment, education, and health care. Our projects encompass a combination of research, development, and training.</p>

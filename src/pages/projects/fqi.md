**[Future Quest Island-Explorations (FQI-E)](https://thinkcollege.net/about/what-is-think-college/future-quest-island-explorations)** is an online accessible college & career readiness curriculum that uses gaming strategies to motivate and support improved self-concept, social and emotional competence, and early college and career awareness for upper elementary students with and without disability in grades 3-5 using the evidenced-based “Possible Selves” framework. 
 
This online curriculum allows students to choose an avatar and hovercraft where they progress through a series of lessons on a cluster of islands, focusing on various aspects of their possible selves. The Possible Selves framework addresses individuals’ perceived future self-concept and guides students in thinking about the future with an emphasis on nurturing academic and personal motivation. It includes components of self-concept that have to do with ‘what I can be, what I would like to be, and what I am afraid of becoming’ (Ruvolo & Markus, 1992). Through a structured process, students describe their hoped-for, expected, and feared possible selves and use the information to create a visual representation of their “Possible Self.” 
 
Using the principles of universal design for learning, FQI-E is designed so that all students can create e-portfolios of their hopes, dreams, and goals as a person, learner, worker, and friend. These e-portfolios can then assist IEP teams in developing better secondary and postsecondary goals and outcomes for students.

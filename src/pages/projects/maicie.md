  The Massachusetts Inclusive Concurrent Enrollment Initiative (MAICEI) program at University of Massachusetts Boston (UMB) offers inclusive higher education opportunities to partnering school districts that support high school students with intellectual disabilities, ages 18–21. Students can increase their academic, social, and career outcomes by sharing the same experiences as their college peers and enrolling in undergraduate courses as non-degree-seeking students.</p>

          <h4>Virtual Information Sessions </h4>
<p>We encourage all interested students, families, and school districts to attend a virtual Information session with Ashley Luce, the UMass Boston MAICEI program coordinator, to learn more about the MAICEI program. </p>
<p>During these virtual sessions, we will share a comprehensive overview of college-based transition services and the MAICEI program. Current students and peer mentors will host an informative panel where they share their experiences and answer questions from the audience.</p>

          <h4>Application Process: </h4>
<p>Students may apply for fall or spring enrollment. The application requires student and district transition staff signatures. </p>
<p>All students who apply must participate in an interview with the MAICEI program coordinator before acceptance. Once accepted, the student will meet with their program coordinator to complete a person-centered plan and develop a course wish list. Then, students can meet with disability services to complete an accommodation plan and register for classes.</p>

      <div class="accordion-body"><p>The state-funded <a href="https://www.mass.edu/strategic/maicei.asp">Massachusetts Inclusive Concurrent Enrollment Initiative</a> (MAICEI) supports partnerships between local school districts and two- and four-year public colleges and universities in Massachusetts. &ldquo;Concurrent enrollment&rdquo; means that participating students are still eligible for special education services, even though they have finished four years of high school. Students who are enrolled in a MAICEI program receive special education transition services at the same time through their school district. </p></div>

      <div class="accordion-body"><p>Evidence shows that students benefit academically and transition to young adulthood more independently when they can engage in the array of academic, social, and career development activities that are typical for all college students on campus, rather than remain in high school for transition services. </p>
<p>Students participating in MAICEI are fully included in the campus community. They can focus on career planning and employment, self-advocacy, and other self-determination skills that support their post-secondary interests and activities. </p>
<p>For example, students participate in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inclusive college courses that support their personal, academic, and career goals</li>
  <li>social activities on campus, including student organizations and other extracurricular activities</li>
  <li>person-centered planning</li>
  <li>paid work and internships</li>
  <li>independent travel</li>
</ul>
<p>Students participating in MAICEI quickly establish new social networks, join campus-wide events, learn to use public transportation to and from campus, acquire academic knowledge and skills, and build strategies to find competitive employment.  </p></div>

Community life engagement refers to all the ways that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities access and participate in their communities outside of employment. Activities can include volunteer work; postsecondary, adult, or continuing education; accessing community facilities such as the library, gym, or recreation center; any activities that people with and without disabilities do in their spare time. CLE activities may support  career exploration  , wrap around work time, or serve as a retirement option. ICI is conducting research on CLE to develop guidance for states and service providers on how to improve CLE supports while maintaining a focus on Employment First.

This [one-page, accessible flyer](https://www.thinkwork.org//sites/default/files/files/CLE_flyer_2023_PL.pdf) provides a plain language overview of the definition of Community Life Engagement, and the four most important things to consider:

## Community Life Engagement Toolkit is here

The toolkit was developed to help service providers develop and improve high quality supports for community life engagement (CLE). It contains guideposts for success, a self-assessment tool, real-world examples of service providers making CLE happen, and other helpful resources and tools.  You can access the CLE toolkit here:  [https://cletoolkit.communityinclusion.org/](https://cletoolkit.communityinclusion.org/)

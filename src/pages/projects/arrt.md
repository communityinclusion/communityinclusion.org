<h2 class="card-title">What is the ARRT Program?</h2>
<ul>
<li>3-year postdoctoral training program on employment for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD)</li>
<li>Provides advanced, multidisciplinary training in IDD employment research</li>
<li>Addresses the critical need for better representation and capacity in the IDD research workforce and field</li>
</ul>
<p>The ARRT Program is housed at the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston and brings together ICI’s expertise from the School of Global Inclusion and Social Development (SGISD) at UMass Boston and the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS). ARRT is funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR).</p>

<h4 id="we-need-better-representation-and-capacity-in-the-idd-research-workforce-and-field-how-do-we-know-">We need better representation and capacity in the IDD research workforce and field! How do we know?</h4>
<p><strong>The workforce does not fully reflect or meet the needs of the populations it serves.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>People from a wide variety of communities  and people with disabilities are underrepresented in the employment services workforce</li>
<li>Qualified people from different  backgrounds don’t enter or stay in the field because they lack role models</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IDD research is not inclusive, and outcomes reflect that.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are differences in disability &amp; IDD employment outcomes</li>
<li>Current research interventions lack the broad range of perspectives, which limits the research effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These issues are exacerbated by systemic technological, architectural, and environmental barriers  &amp; weak institutional support.</strong></p>

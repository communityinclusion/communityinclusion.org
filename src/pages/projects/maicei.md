      The Inclusive Education Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Boston offers higher education opportunities for students through partnerships with local school districts and state agencies. The Inclusive Education Initiative is a fully inclusive, non-degree seeking, enrollment opportunity designed to support students with intellectual disabilities, autism, or other developmental disabilities to go to college. Students can increase their academic, social, and career outcomes by sharing the same experiences as their college peers.  </p>
<p class="fs-4">The state-funded [Massachusetts Inclusive Postsecondary Education] (MAIPSE) supports partnerships between local school districts, the Department of Developmental Services (DDS), the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commision (MRC), other state agencies, and two- and four-year public colleges and universities in Massachusetts.

  The Massachusetts Inclusive Concurrent Enrollment Initiative (MAICEI) program at the University of Massachusetts Boston offers inclusive higher education opportunities to partnering school districts that support high school students with intellectual disabilities and autism, ages 18-22. Students can increase their academic, social, and career outcomes by sharing the same experiences as their college peers and enrolling in undergraduate courses as non-degree-seeking students.</p>
<p class="fs-4">The state-funded [<a href="https://www.mass.edu/strategic/maicei.asp">Massachusetts Inclusive Concurrent Enrollment Initiative</a>] (MAICEI) supports partnerships between local school districts and two- and four-year public colleges and universities in Massachusetts.

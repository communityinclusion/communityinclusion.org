[StateData.info](https://www.statedata.info/) offers publications and data related to employment and disability. It builds off of decades of research conducted at ICI about the work of state intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) agencies, vocational rehabilitation agencies, and community organizations providing employment support to people with IDD.

This interactive data hub can help policymakers measure the impact of legislation changes, and allows advocates to create graphs and charts to influence decision-making in their state. State agency staff and leadership can use the data to monitor, report on, and analyze their outcomes. Employment providers can identify benchmarks and measure their progress against them, while researchers can perform rapid analyses and download spreadsheets to study data on a national or state-by-state level.

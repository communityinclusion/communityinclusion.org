## Mission

As practitioners, researchers, teachers and advocates, we support systems change and partner with children and adults with disabilities, their families, and communities to advocate for personal choice, self-determination, and social and economic justice.

## Vision

ICI envisions a world that is socially just, where children and adults with disabilities participate fully in their communities and lead rewarding, self-directed and fulfilling lives.

## Values

To help realize this vision and mission, we value:

_Being a CHAMPION_ of children and adults with disabilities through advocacy and education.

_Fostering COMPETENCIES_ that promote the full potential for all.  

_Engaging in COMMUNICATION_ to advance knowledge across domains — education, employment, health care, community involvement, and quality of life — with and for children and adults with disabilities.

_Building CONFIDENCE_ in children and adults with disabilities so they can realize self-driven goals.

_Affording CHOICES_ for self-directed and well-informed decision-making, so that people of all abilities can shape their lives.

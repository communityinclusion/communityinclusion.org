## Resource Guide

Inclusion means that all people, regardless of their abilities, disabilities, or health care needs, have the right to:

*   Be respected and appreciated as valuable members of their communities
*   Participate in recreational activities in neighborhood settings
*   Work at jobs in the community that pay a competitive wage and have careers that use their capacities to the fullest
*   Attend general education classes with peers from preschool through college and continuing education

## Inclusion applies to all parts of life

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 mandates that people with disabilities have freedom, equality, and opportunity to participate fully in public life.

## Support

People with disabilities may need support to participate fully in their communities. This support can range from alterations (called "accommodations") to make a space accessible for a person with physical or sensory limitations, to training for teachers so they can teach students of all abilities and talents, to assistance from counselors and friends to succeed in a job or a recreational activity. Support should respect the wants, needs, and choices of the person with a disability.

Support can be provided to...

*   Students--to build on strengths & accommodate learning styles
*   Families--to encourage involvement & mutual support
*   Educators--to provide training & resources
*   Employers and co-workers--to promote a work culture that welcomes all

...To ensure meaningful participation in school, work, and social community.

## Inclusion is not...

*   clustering people with disabilities into one home, classroom, workplace, or social center
*   giving "special privileges" to people with disabilities
*   feeling sorry for people with disabilities

## Inclusion can look like...

*   Martina, a woman with a visual impairment, sings in her church choir.
*   Tyrone became interested in politics through his city's Independent Living Center (ILC), a resource center for people with disabilities. He now advocates for his own rights and teaches other people about disability rights issues.
*   Esmeralda, a woman with cerebral palsy, started working in a local office after graduation, where she goes for lunch and after-work outings with her co-workers.
*   Adam, who has Down syndrome, is an Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America.
*   Lee, an eight-year-old girl with special health care needs, attends her local elementary school, with help from her school nurse and a portable ventilator.

No one is "too disabled" to be part of their community.

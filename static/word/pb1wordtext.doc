Provisions in the Workforce Investment Act Describing the Interplay between Workforce Investment Systems and Vocational Rehabilitation Programs 

Introduction 

On August 7, 1998 President Clinton signed into law the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-220). Title I of the Act provides assistance to states interested in establishing statewide and local workforce investment systems. Title IV of the Workforce Investment Act sets out a complete rewrite of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, including title I which authorizes the vocational rehabilitation program. 

The purpose of this policy brief is to identify and describe the sections in title I of the Workforce Investment Act (statewide and local workforce investment systems) that specifically reference the vocational rehabilitation program, individuals with disabilities, and organizations representing individuals with disabilities. The policy brief also identifies and describes specific references to statewide and local workforce investment systems in title I of the Rehabilitation Act (the vocational rehabilitation program). 

It is our hope that this brief will provide policy makers, researchers, individuals with disabilities, organizations representing individuals with disabilities, state agencies serving adults with disabilities (e.g., Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Developmental Disabilities, Education, Health, Welfare), community rehabilitation programs, and other stakeholders a focus on some of the key areas of policy in the Workforce Investment Act, in order to ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided "effective and meaningful participation in workforce investment activities" (Section 100(a)(1)(G) of the Rehabilitation Act) 

Subsequent issue briefs will identify additional provisions in the Workforce Investment Act that do not include specific references to "disability" or "vocational rehabilitation" but are nonetheless critical to achieving the Act's objective of ensuring effective and meaningful participation for individuals with disabilities.

The membership of the Board, which is appointed by the Governor, must include the lead state agency officials with responsibility for the programs and activities (including vocational rehabilitation programs authorized under title I of the Rehabilitation Act) carried out by one-stop partners (Section 111(b)(1)(C)(vi)(I)). 

- Functions. The Board must assist the Governor in developing the State plan and in developing and continuously improving a statewide system of activities carried out through a one-stop delivery system.

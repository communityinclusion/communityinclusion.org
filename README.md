# Hi Friends, this is the repo for the ICI website (development)

It currently uses a number of terrific open source tools, including Gatsby, React, Github, Tachyons, Netlify and Netlify CMS. 

The code is just code, feel free to take and use it. Content and branding is ours and comes from government funding, so if you take that, folks are just going to get grumpy and you'll wake up up the lawyers. So don't do that.

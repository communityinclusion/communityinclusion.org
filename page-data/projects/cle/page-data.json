Activities can include volunteer work; postsecondary, adult, or continuing education; accessing community facilities such as the library, gym, or recreation center; any activities that people with and without disabilities do in their spare time. CLE activities may support  career exploration  , wrap around work time, or serve as a retirement option. ICI is conducting research on CLE to develop guidance for states and service providers on how to improve CLE supports while maintaining a focus on Employment First.</p>\n<p>This one-page, accessible flyer provides a plain language overview of the definition of Community Life Engagement, and the four most important things to consider:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thinkwork.org/sites/default/files/files/CLE_flyer_2017_plain%20language_0.pdf\"><img src=\"../../CLE_flyer_2017_plain%20language_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"plain language thumbnail\"></a></p>\n<h2>Community Life Engagement Toolkit is here</h2>\n<p>The toolkit was developed to help service providers develop and improve high quality supports for community life engagement (CLE). It contains guideposts for success, a self-assessment tool, real-world examples of service providers making CLE happen, and other helpful resources and tools.

This training occurs both in face-to-face and online platforms. During her time at ICI Maria has worked on various grant projects that have given her expertise in the areas of transition and postsecondary education for students with significant disabilities. Specifically, she has supported individual students from the beginning of the transition process by facilitating Person Centered Planning to identify goals, coordinated teams of people to support that student in achieving those goals and provided educational coaching support to students attending college classes. More recently, Maria serves as a liaison to colleges supporting students with intellectual disabilities as part of a national coordinating center on the topic. Prior to her work at ICI, Maria served as a Statewide Transition Specialist for the Arizona Department of Education (ADE) where she focused on ensuring statewide compliance of high schools with transition-related state and federal requirements. Mariaâ€™s areas of expertise span the topics of transition and postsecondary education, and therefore her work has been very focused on addressing the barriers to effective transition planning and has provided technical assistance to K-12 and higher education staff to develop plans to overcome those barriers.","staff_ed":"B.S., Rehabilitation and Human Services, Boston University\nM.S., Rehabilitation Counseling, Boston University","staff_email":"maria.dragoumanos@umb.edu","staff_link":null,"staff_phone":"(617) 287-5904","staff_pubs":null},"id":"7c675077-187e-56ca-9460-c0d094398a76","fields":{"slug":"/maria-dragoumanos/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/maria-dragoumanos/","breadcrumb":{"location":"/maria-dragoumanos/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/maria-dragoumanos","crumbLabel":"maria-dragoumanos"}]}}}}

As a project lead, she is involved in building projects from their original idea to their organization and implementation. She also develops publications that demonstrate the research findings and outline the strategies that arise from the findings. Her major interest is research, developing the essential questions that need to be answered and then creating the best research design to answer the questions. She is currently working on a longitudinal case study project that seeks to discover how people with disabilities find employment in the rapidly changing world of state systems and disability policy.\n\nDoris is intensely fascinated by disability as a social construction and by the ways in which the definition of disability alters depending on social context. This has been a lifetime interest, as she has worked in different roles in the employment field since 1983, when she was involved in the Job Training Partnership Act program. She has worked in human resources and as a recruiter for an employment agency. In addition to her diverse employment background, she has taught a variety of sociology courses at the university level while focusing on using a service-learning approach. Doris received her Ph.D. in sociology from Boston University with an emphasis on medical sociology and qualitative methodology.","staff_ed":"B.A., Georgian Court College\nPh.D., Boston University","staff_email":"doris.hamner@umb.edu","staff_link":null,"staff_phone":"617/287-4364","staff_pubs":null},"id":"4f7daf09-c309-5575-ad8c-3a222724b441","fields":{"slug":"/doris-hamner/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/doris-hamner/","breadcrumb":{"location":"/doris-hamner/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/doris-hamner","crumbLabel":"doris-hamner"}]}}}}

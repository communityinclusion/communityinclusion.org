People with disabilities and their experiences are diverse, therefore numerous approaches are necessary to address the multiple forms of oppression being experienced both individually and collectively. As we see pronounced signs of systemic racism across the country, we must commit to integrating the fight against inequities into everything we do as an organization during this painful time.</p>\n<p>It is important to publicly speak out against about exclusion and injustice. However, we must also examine our own organization. We will continue to look closely at our systems, policies, research and practice to ensure that they connect to our vision of inclusion. When we fall short in bringing an antiracism approach to our work, we ask you to hold us accountable and help us grow and improve.</p>\n<p>ICI aligns itself with SGISD in our efforts to dismantle oppressive systems and instead promote fully inclusive practices. We stand with SGISD and their message of support.</p>\n<p><em>We can do better. We can be better. We must do better and be better, together.</em></p>\n<p><em>We live in a complicated time. Black people continue to be violently attacked and killed; Asian Americans experience bigoted attacks as a result of COVID-19; people of color face disproportional illness and death due to the pandemic; and more. This list, while in no means exhaustive, shows many of the reasons why we at SGISD must rededicate ourselves to undertake work that creates social change, and promotes human rights, justice and equity for marginalized individuals and communities.</em></p>\n<p><em>Systemic racism impacts all components of peopleâ€™s lives, whether in access to health care or education, in regard to personal safety, or through economic consequences. It is time to listen, educate, and devote ourselves to fighting the ideals and systems that oppress our friends, loved ones, colleagues, and communities.</em></p>\n<p><em>At SGISD we are committed to studying and speaking out against issues that promote exclusion. We cannot be complacent. We must take steps to improve our own work, and our dedication to the experiences of our students, faculty and staff. We will continue to look closely at our practices, policies and curriculum to ensure that it connects to our vision of inclusion. We also commit to promote and develop fully inclusive and antiracist practices, beginning with ourselves, within our organization and in the work that we do.</em></p>\n<p><em>We want to do better and we need your help to do so. We ask the members of our community to guide us in this self-reflection and stand with us as we work towards finding solutions and taking collective action. Help us so that this movement is not merely a moment, but instead a catalyst toward real change</em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 5th, 2020","title":"Statement","tags":["Community Inclusion","Inclusion","Social Justice","Equity","Human Rights"],"posttype":"news","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"width":300,"height":300,"src":"/ici-dev/static/51f9309c3be48464210a00c2310d5450/56e34/ICI.png","srcSet":"/ici-dev/static/51f9309c3be48464210a00c2310d5450/56e34/ICI.png 1x"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2020-06-05_statement/","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2020-06-05_statement/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2020-06-05_statement","crumbLabel":"2020-06-05_statement"}]}}}}

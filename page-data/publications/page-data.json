Towards that end, we are hosting a variety of listening sessions with multiple audiences to reflect the level of stakeholder engagement that has been a hallmark of the RRTC since our launch. In this listening session, we will focus on a “knowledge to action” agenda that grounds our research in issues important to the lives of individuals with disabilities and the systems and people that provide support. This engagement and feedback on our research findings will help us to refine State of the Science papers, and will inform a one-day event in Washington, DC that will connect federal policymakers with voices from the field.</p>\r\r\n<p>This session will include a short orientation to the project, and a brief summary of its major findings.

The goal of the project was to assist community rehabilitation providers (CRPs) in facilitating integrated employment / customized employment outcomes for individuals served by these programs. Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in partnership with the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at the University of Massachusetts Boston submitted a proposal and was awarded the cooperative agreement in October of 2002.</p>\r\r\n<p>For the purpose of this Guide, customized employment is defined as a process for individualizing the employment relationship between an employee and an employer in ways that meet the needs of both. Customized employment is based on an individualized negotiation between the strengths, conditions and interests of the person with a disability and the identified business needs of the employer or the self-employment business chosen by the job seeker. Job negotiation uses job development or restructuring strategies that result in responsibilities being customized and individually negotiated to fit the requirements of the job. Please see Appendix 6 of this Guide for more information on customized employment.</p>\r\r\n<p>A key component of the proposal submitted by VCU and ICI was the identification of successful CRPs in the United States who would provide technical assistance to other providers. This network of exemplary programs was identified using a “snowball” strategy in which programs were nominated for consideration by nationally known consultants to VCU and ICI. VCU and ICI then selected 10 CRPs based on these recommendations and their exemplary track records of facilitating customized employment outcomes. These mentor organizations demonstrated expertise in implementing customized employment and in facilitating organizational change with a goal of expanding customized employment opportunities. Named the Community Rehabilitation Program (CRP) Leadership Network, these leaders or “mentors” were used extensively throughout the five years of the project to provide training and technical assistance.</p>","authors":"John Butterworth, Cecelia Gandolfo, W.

The NCC, administered by Think College at the Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston, is charged with providing technical assistance, coordination, and evaluation of model demonstration programs. The NCC is also required by HEOA to convene a Workgroup to develop and recommend model criteria, standards, and components of higher education programs for students with intellectual disability.

Despite these achievements, the promise of integrated employment has not been realized for many individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD).

This paper presents findings from a qualitative study that addresses the question, “How do siblings support each other after parents no longer can provide care to the person with I/DD?” Findings in this study suggest that siblings with and without disabilities experience reciprocity as a transitive exchange, which occurs through the creation of social capital in their families and community, and that nondisabled siblings mobilize their social capital to provide support to their sibling after parents pass away.

But despite these clear intentions, unemployment of individuals with disabilities continues to be a major public policy issue. Labor force statistics for December 2010 indicate that 28 percent of working-age adults with disabilities are employed, compared with 70 percent of people without disabilities. Labor force data also indicate that workers with disabilities have experienced significantly higher levels of job loss and hardship during the recession of the late 2000s. For people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), the disparity in labor market participation grows. In FY2003, only 26 percent of individuals with IDD supported by community rehabilitation providers (CRPs) worked in integrated jobs, including both individual jobs and group supported employment. At the same time, participation in sheltered or facility-based employment and non-work services has grown steadily, suggesting that employment services continue to be viewed as an add-on service rather than a systemic change.</p>\r\r\n<p>States vary widely in their commitment to integrated employment. In recent years, state IDD agencies have launched employment working groups, employment initiatives, and employment-first policies and agendas.

The shrinking workforce has increased employers' interest in looking at the full range of potential workers, including those previously considered unemployable. The growing economy—coupled with the declining birth rate, the increase in technology and supports for a diverse workforce, and the increasing expectation that all persons should be provided with the opportunity to work—has led to a new view of individuals with disabilities. Many persons with disabilities perceived as not able to seek employment were not included in the unemployment statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor and thus were not counted as part of the available workforce. Labor force participation rates of persons with disabilities are less than one-third of those without disabilities.</p>\r\r\n<p>Legislative and administrative initiatives in the past ten years have stressed equality of opportunity and workforce participation of persons with disabilities as a high priority. As in the case of welfare reform, the focus has moved to employment as a realistic and preferred goal for many persons with disabilities. In response to these initiatives, the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the primary health care resource for many persons with disabilities, has sought to support states in their effort to assist persons with disabilities interested in working to gain employment. The expansion of the Medicaid Buy-In and the passage of the Ticket to Work legislation (TTWWIIA) have both been directed at addressing some of the major barriers to employment for persons with disabilities. The Medicaid Infrastructure Grants (MIGs) encourage states to review and revise their health coverage practices to support persons with disabilities to enter and remain in employment. Through the expansion of the MIG initiative, CMS has encouraged states to develop supports and services that will enhance employment access and job retention for persons with disabilities.</p>","authors":"William Kiernan, John Halliday, and Heike Boeltzig","download_url":"https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=ici_pubs"}},{"node":{"title":"From Paper to Action: State-Level Interagency Agreements for Supported Employment of People with Disabilities","abstract":"<p>Over the past decade there has been an increasing national emphasis on the participation of individuals with disabilities in the labor force. This concern was recognized through Executive Order No. 13078 signed by President Bill Clinton in March 1998, establishing the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities. The Task Force was charged with a mission \"to create a coordinated and aggressive policy to bring adults with disabilities into gainful employment at a rate that is as close as possible to that of the general adult population\" (Section 1 (c)). Legislation and policy changes have also been directed to increase employment opportunities. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) was implemented with a broad goal of consolidating, coordinating, and improving all national workforce development initiatives, including vocational rehabilitation and youth employment programs. The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (P.L. 101-336), the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (TWWIIA) of 1999 (P.L. 106-170), amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act (most recently included in WIA), and changes to Medicaid regulations are all intended to expand access to employment. One mechanism for improving employment outcomes that is increasingly being emphasized or required in legislation and regulation is interagency agreements or interagency collaboration.

Equitable programs contribute to balancing the needs and desires of the various groups in society; whereas efficient programs are those that serve to increase the net value of goods and services available to society. Benefit-cost analysis is a tool developed to determine whether a program produces effects that justify the costs incurred to operate the program. The benefit-cost model presented in this monograph requires the reader to:</p>\r\r\n<ol>\r\r\n<li>Understand the concept of an analytical perspective;</li>\r\r\n<li>Move beyond viewing benefit-cost analysis as a simple ratio of benefits to costs;</li>\r\r\n<li>Include both monetized and non-monetized benefits in the analysis; and</li>\r\r\n<li>Consider what is a benefit and what is a cost, and to whom.</li>\r\r\n</ol>\r\r\n<p>Thus, potential users of the proposed model are encouraged to take a broader perspective on the benefits and costs of a program, intervention, or service, rather than reducing the analysis to a simple ratio of benefits to costs. The purpose of benefit-cost analysis is to determine whether a program's benefits outweigh its costs. The primary issue addressed by a benefit-cost analysis is whether the impacts of a program, intervention, or service are big enough to justify the costs needed to produce them. Benefit-cost analysis depends upon the availability of cost estimates, benefits to program participants, and impact statements, which are the statistically significant mean differences of costs and benefits between the programs, interventions, or services being compared.</p>\r\r\n<p>Benefit-cost analysis requires both an understanding and use of a number of terms. The more important of these include:</p>\r\r\n<ul>\r\r\n<li>Benefits: Positive outcomes that accrue to program participants such as increased wages, regular job, or reduced use of alternative programs.</li>\r\r\n<li>Costs: Expenditures associated with a particular program, intervention, or service such as program expenses, forgone market output (that is, opportunity costs), or increased use of complementary programs.</li>\r\r\n<li>Efficiency: The extent to which there is an increase in the net value of goods and services available to society (that is, being productive with minimum waste).</li>\r\r\n<li>Equity: The balance between the needs and desires of the various groups in society (that is, fairness).</li>\r\r\n<li>Impacts: The significant mean differences on selected cost and benefit measures between the groups or conditions being compared.</li>\r\r\n<li>Monetized: Benefits or costs to which a monetary value can be assigned (for example, wages, taxes paid, reduced public taxes).</li>\r\r\n<li>Nonmonetized: Benefits to which a monetary value cannot be assigned (for example, improved quality of life or increased satisfaction).</li>\r\r\n<li>Analytical perspective: Benefit-cost analysis addresses the perspective of different groups in society that are effected by a program, service, or intervention. The three perspectives used in the benefit-cost model presented include the participant, rest of society (that is, the \"taxpayer\"), and social (that is, \"society as a whole,\" which includes the sum benefits and costs generated from the previous two perspectives). The inclusion of these three perspectives in a benefit-cost analysis is necessary since a program effect (such as taxes withheld) can be a benefit to some and at the same time a cost to others.</li>\r\r\n</ul>\r\r\n<p>The benefit-cost analysis model presented on subsequent pages is based on the work of Conley & Noble (1990), Cimera (1998), Cimera and Rusch (1999), Kerachsky et al (1985), Noble & Conley (1987), Rossi, Freeman & Lipsey (1999), Rusch (1990), Rusch, Conley & McCaughlin (1993), Schalock (1995), Schalock and Thornton (1988), Thornton (1984), and Thornton and Maynard (1989).</p>","authors":"Robert Schalock and John Butterworth","download_url":"https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=ici_pubs"}},{"node":{"title":"Massachusetts Employment and Disability Snapshot Report, 2000-2005","abstract":"<p>This monograph presents the results of secondary analysis of the RSA-911 database from the Rehabilitation Services Administration.

In March 2010, Congress passed and the President signed into law the \"Affordable Care Act\" (ACA). 1 On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld all of the provisions of the ACA, with the exception of provisions mandating Medicaid expansion. The Supreme Court held that if a State chooses not to participate in this expansion of Medicaid eligibility for low-income adults, the State may not, as a consequence, lose Federal funding for its existing Medicaid program.</p>\r\r\n<p>The ACA includes significant new potential funding sources to pay for health-related VR services and supports, including private health insurance and Medicaid. Under the ACA, essential health benefits, including rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, will be more readily available to an expanded population of persons through the private insurance market. Also, under the ACA an expanded number of persons may, at a State's discretion, receive health care services under the Medicaid program.</p>\r\r\n<p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the potential impact of the ACA on the payment for certain health-related VR services, including physical and mental restoration services, assistive technology devices and services, and personal assistance services. According to RSA-2 (Financial Report) for 2011, the total expenditure for diagnoses and treatment of physical and mental impairments by State VR agencies was $263,920,111, which equals 14 percent of the total amount of purchased services. This amount ranged among State VR agencies from less than 1 percent to 69 percent of the total amount for purchased services. For example, the Florida General Agency expended $34,414,379 for diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental impairments, which represented 30 percent of the total amount expended for purchased services. Thus, for certain States, pursuing strategies that minimize expenditures for physical and mental restoration and other health-related services and supports may increase the amount of funds available for other VR services and to expand the number of clients served.</p>","authors":"Robert Silverstein","download_url":"https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=ici_pubs"}},{"node":{"title":"Case Studies of Emerging/Innovative Vocational Rehabilitation Agency Practices in Improving Employment Outcomes for Individuals with Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities","abstract":"<p>The Vocational Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (VR-RRTC.org) based at the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at the University of Massachusetts Boston partnered with national content experts to identify promising VR employment practices serving people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD).

The number of individuals supported in integrated employment by state IDD agencies has remained the same since 2000, participation in non-work services has grown rapidly, and promising practices for employment supports identified in the research are not widely implemented.

In 2013, only 23% of working-age people with cognitive disabilities—a broad demographic category that includes individuals with IDD—were employed, compared to 72% of people without disabilities. While over 30 states have adopted an Employment First policy (a declaration that employment is the priority outcome for people with disabilities), a key challenge is ensuring that supports meet the standards for best practice. Employment supports are delivered by what we refer to as “employment consultants.” We use this term to describe staff who support individuals with disabilities to find and keep an individual integrated job in the community. Other titles may include employment specialist, job developer, or job coach.</p>\r\r\n<p>This brief: Shares what we know about bringing best practice to scale; Introduces a line of research that builds a strategy for an effective workforce for employment supports.</p>","authors":"ThinkWork! at the Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass Boston","download_url":"https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=ici_pubs"}},{"node":{"title":"Knowledge Translation and Support for Individuals and Families (Bringing Employment First to Scale, Issue No. 5)","abstract":"<p>With the persistently low competitive employment rate for working-age people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), a main focus area for the field of disability research has been on the interaction between the individual and the service system. Yet we know much less about the interaction between systems and families around employment. Family engagement is key to successful employment and life planning, often leading individuals with disabilities on the path to employment when family members serve as role models for work ethic and behavior. Family members may also provide logistical support, including coaching and advice, help with planning and organizing work schedules and activities, and transportation and other resources. Moreover, research has shown that a person with IDD is most likely to be employed when their parents want them to be employed and believe that they can work. Despite these findings, we also know that parents often lack adequate knowledge to support their child’s transition to adult life. Family factors found to influence outcomes include lack of information about work incentives and fear of losing benefits.</p>\r\r\n<p>This brief: Summarizes what we know about the effectiveness of strategies being used to inform, engage, and support individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and their families in the development of a positive employment vision; Introduces a new line of individual and family engagement research that culminates in the development of a “small touch” intervention and strategy. This strategy addresses unemployment of people with IDD as an information mismatch between service systems and the family system.

Community provider organizations and their staff are the primary source of day and employment supports for people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD). Among this large provider community, variation of services and employment philosophies exists. Many believe that facility-based programs are essential for individuals with disabilities who are having difficulty getting or maintaining competitive work in the labor force, and have limited plans to expand competitive integrated employment. Others believe that all individuals with IDD can work if provided the appropriate supports.

Characteristics of the workforce that connects job seekers with intellectual and developmental disabilities to employment (Bringing Employment First to Scale, Issue No. 7)","abstract":"<p>In 1987, the Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at the University of Massachusetts Boston began a series of surveys aimed at providing a longitudinal description of the characteristics and service delivery provided by Community Rehabilitation Providers (CRPs)(Domin & Butterworth, 2012). Despite direct support staff comprising one of the nation’s largest labor market segments, there has been very little research into the wages and stability of that workforce (Bogenschutz, Hewitt, Nord, & Hepperlen, 2014). Additionally, most of the literature regarding employment consultants has focused on service outcomes of the individuals served. However, according to Luecking, Fabian, and Tilson (2004), “…Regardless of the job seeker’s level of motivation, skill, experience, attitude, and support system, his or her ability to get a job will often depend on the effectiveness of employment specialists…” The 2014 National Survey of Community Rehabilitation Providers sought to gather information on the roles of and investment in employment consultants within the CRPs (see sidebar.) Employment consultants are direct support staff who assist job seekers with disabilities with finding paid individual integrated employment. This includes professionals with titles such as employment specialist, job developer, rehabilitation counselor, and employment support professional.

We have a wide range of goals today and will present for you some of our current thinking on this relatively small, but expanding interest in sibling-disability research. First, we highlight how sibling disability research has differed and been narrower in focus than other research about siblings where neither has a disability and trace the reason for this to institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation. We then identify the impact of the overwhelmingly psychological framing of most historical research about siblings without disabilities, highlighting how this has led to a ‘tragic’, medicalised framing of their experiences and to the marginalisation of people with disabilities from the field. Through a review of the literature, we highlight how this framing persists across the life-course. Finally, we identify some newer sibling disability research that has taken on more of a critical disability studies perspective, including hearing the voices of siblings with disabilities, and make an argument for how and why this improves the representation of siblings’ experiences. In ending the discussion, we suggest some future possibilities for how continuing to extend this critical disability studies perspective can continue to strengthen the field by showing how siblinghood intersects with disability and family identity, life course and privilege.","authors":"John Kramer and ThinkWork! at the Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass Boston","download_url":"https://works.bepress.com/john-kramer/3/download/"}},{"node":{"title":"Effective supervision and career advancement of individuals with IDD","abstract":"<div class=\"line\" id=\"line-5\">As professionals in the disability field, we are in a unique position to support the career goals of individuals with IDD who want to work as researchers.

But despite these clear intentions, unemployment of individuals with disabilities continues to be a major public policy issue.</p>\r\r\n<p>For people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), the disparity in labor market participation grows. Data suggest only 14.7% of individuals who receive supports from state IDD agencies work in either individual or group integrated employment, and 19% of individuals who receive day services from a state IDD agency participate in a service designed to support integrated employment (Butterworth, Hall, Smith, Migliore, Winsor, Domin, & Sulewski, 2013; Human Services Research Institute, 2012). At the same time, participation in sheltered or facility-based employment and non-work services has grown steadily, suggesting that employment services continue to be viewed as an add-on service rather than a systemic change (Butterworth et al., 2013; Mank, Cioffi, & Yovanoff, 2003).</p>\r\r\n<p>Data on the state of employment for individuals with disabilities (as briefly synthesized above) is available through a myriad of data collection systems. A growing emphasis on government accountability at the state and federal levels has increased interest in the collection and use of data on employment outcomes. However, many disability data systems are only loosely coordinated across various agencies, and many state service systems have fragmented and incomplete data systems in place. Stapleton & Thornton (2009, p.4) note that “(a)lthough the challenges to improving the data are substantial, they pale in comparison to the likely consequences of failing to do so, both for people with disabilities and for taxpayers.”</p>\r\r\n<p>This toolkit is designed to provide guidance on how to use currently available national and state-level aggregate data sets to weave together a picture of the employment outcomes of transition-age youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Data sets are grouped by the type of data they report: agencylevel data, and general employment trend data.</p>","authors":"Jean Winsor and Alberto Migliore","download_url":"https://scholarworks.umb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&amp;context=ici_pubs"}},{"node":{"title":"Partnerships in Employment: State Self-Assessment Toolkit for Systems Change in the Transition of Youth and Young Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities from High School","abstract":"<p>This self-assessment tool was developed for those who wish to embark on state-wide governmental systems change to improve high school transition and employment outcomes for youth and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Its purpose is to aid in the development of a work plan that is based on a review of the state policies, practices, and strategies that impact transition from school and opportunities for competitive integrated employment of youth and young adults with IDD.</p>\r\r\n<p>This tool incorporates research identifying elements of state government that support high rates of participation in integrated employment (Hall et al., 2007), research on predictors of positive employment outcomes for young adults with IDD (NTACT, 2016), and the experience of the eight states that were 2011–2012 awardees of the Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Partnerships in Employment (PIE) Transition Systems Change grants.

Information on PIE and its implementation in these states can be found at www.thinkwork.org/partnerships-employment.</p>\r\r\n<p>When it comes to employment, this document prioritizes competitive integrated employment, defined as full-time or part-time work at minimum wage or higher, with wages and benefits similar to those of people without disabilities performing the same work, and full integration with co-workers without disabilities.
